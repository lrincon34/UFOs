# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

The purpose of this project was to help Dana create a an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. We built two things in order to obtain the results we wanted:
  1. A webpage to allow users to view the data using HTML, and
  2. A table that presents the data uisng JavaScript.
  
Since there are several UFO sightings and each sighting contains a lot of specific data, Dana added filters to the table to allow users to condense the data by their own criteria. The following is an example of the information related to one UFO sighting:
- **datetime**: 1/1/2010
- **city**: bonita
- **state**: ca
- **country**: us
- **shape**: light
- **durationMinutes**: 13 minutes
- **comments**: Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010
