## JavaScript and HTML

The purpose of this project was to help Dana create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. We built two things in order to obtain the results we wanted:
  1. A webpage to allow users to view the data using HTML, and
  2. A table that presents the data using JavaScript.
  
## Filters
Since there are several UFO sightings and each sighting contains a lot of specific data, Dana added filters to the table to allow users to condense the data by their own criteria. The filters that we applied in order to make the search easier and faster were the following: 
  1. Date
  2. City
  3. State
  4. Country 
  5. Shape

## UFO Sighting Details
The following is an example of the information related to one UFO sighting:
- **datetime**: 1/1/2010
- **city**: bonita
- **state**: ca
- **country**: us
- **shape**: light
- **duration in minutes**: 13 minutes
- **comments**: Three bright red lights witnessed floating stationary over San Diego New Years Day 2010

## Recommendation
As you can see, applying filters to the data was a good decision and users will benefit a lot from it. One recommendation I would have, is to add an additional filter for the **duration in minutes ** field. I believe many users would enjoy that. 

## Final Webpage
